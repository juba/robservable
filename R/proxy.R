#' Send commands to a Proxy instance in a Shiny app
#'
#' Creates a robservable-like object that can be used to customize and control a robservable
#' that has already been rendered. For use in Shiny apps and Shiny docs only.
#'
#' Normally, you create a robservable instance using the \code{\link{robservable}} function.
#' This creates an in-memory representation of a robservable that you can customize,
#' print at the R console, include in an R Markdown document, or render as a Shiny output.
#'
#' In the case of Shiny, you may want to further customize a robservable, even after it
#' is rendered to an output. At this point, the in-memory representation of the
#' robservable is long gone, and the user's web browser has already realized the
#' robservable instance.
#'
#' This is where \code{robservableProxy} comes in. It returns an object that can
#' stand in for the usual robservable object. The usual robservable functions
#' can be called, and instead of customizing an in-memory representation,
#' these commands will execute on the already created robservable instance in
#' the browser.
#'
#' @param id single-element character vector indicating the output ID of the
#'   robservable to modify (if invoked from a Shiny module, the namespace will be added
#'   automatically)
#' @param session the Shiny session object to which the robservable belongs; usually the
#'   default value will suffice
#' @param deferUntilFlush indicates whether actions performed against this
#'   instance should be carried out right away, or whether they should be held
#'   until after the next time all of the outputs are updated; defaults to
#'   \code{TRUE}
#'
#' @export

  # with the current namespace, then add the namespace.
  #
  # We could also have unconditionally done `id <- session$ns(id)`, but
  # older versions of robservable would have broken unless the user did session$ns
  # themselves, and we hate to break their code unnecessarily.
